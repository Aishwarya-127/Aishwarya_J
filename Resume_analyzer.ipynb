A proper resume should start with a compelling summary or objective statement outlining career goals and highlighting key skills and achievements. Following that, a detailed work experience section should list previous roles in reverse chronological order, including company name, dates of employment, job title, and bullet points describing responsibilities and accomplishments using the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result).\n",
